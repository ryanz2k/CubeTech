### Tools & Framework

I used vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project. This approach ensures fast load times, no build dependencies, and easy deployment to any static hosting service.

### Design Translation

I analyzed the Figma design to identify the layout structure, color palette, and typography. The CSS uses custom properties for consistent theming, and the layout is built with CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsiveness.

### Challenges

- Creating a responsive carousel that works well on all screen sizes
- Implementing the polaroid-style image collage with CSS transforms

### Future Improvements

- Backend integration for form submissions
- Dark mode toggle
- Multi-language support
